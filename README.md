- **Persistent:** Runs in background and restarts on reboot
- **Styled:** Clean web interface using HTML, CSS, and Flask templates
- **Two Interfaces:**
  - `/` â€” interactive browser UI
  - `/chat` â€” JSON API endpoint

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **ETL Pipeline** (via `etl.py`) merges:
   - `food.csv`
   - `food_nutrient.csv`
   - `nutrient.csv`
   â†’ into `cleaned_nutrition_data.csv`

2. **Flask App (`app.py`)**
   - Uses fuzzy matching to detect food names
   - Detects if user is asking about a nutrient or a recipe
   - Loads cleaned USDA data locally
   - Calls Spoonacular API for live recipe suggestions

3. **Deployment**
   - Hosted on GCP Compute Engine (Ubuntu VM)
   - Flask runs with `gunicorn` under `systemd`
   - Spoonacular API key set via environment variable in systemd config
